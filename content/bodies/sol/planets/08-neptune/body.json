        "Neptune represents a distinct class of planetary bodies known as ice giants, fundamentally differing in composition from the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. Its bulk composition is dominated by heavier elements, primarily oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur, which exist as a dense, hot supercritical fluid mantle above an Earth-mass rocky core [1]. A small fraction of atmospheric methane absorbs red light, contributing to the planet's characteristic deep blue coloration [2].",
        "The planet possesses a highly unusual, complex magnetic field that is strongly tilted at an angle of 47 degrees relative to the rotation axis and significantly offset from the physical center of the planet by more than half its radius [3]. This non-dipolar structure suggests the dynamo generating the field operates within a thin spherical shell of electrically conducting fluid, likely ionized water and ammonia in the mantle, rather than deep within the core [1].",
        "Despite its extreme distance from the Sun and receiving minimal solar irradiation, Neptune exhibits highly dynamic atmospheric weather systems. It features the highest recorded wind speeds in the solar system, with atmospheric flows reaching nearly 600 meters per second, alongside large, transient dark storm systems [4]. The internal heat mechanism required to drive this intense meteorological activity remains a subject of ongoing scientific investigation [2]."
