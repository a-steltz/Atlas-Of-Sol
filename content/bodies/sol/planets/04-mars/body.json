        "Mars is uniquely compelling as a terrestrial planet that preserves a highly accessible, rich geological record of a once-habitable environment. Unlike Earth, where active tectonic recycling continually destroys ancient crust, the Martian surface retains vast networks of ancient river valleys, lakebeds, and deltaic deposits indicating widespread liquid water flowed across its surface during the Noachian and Hesperian periods [1]. This preservation makes Mars a primary laboratory for understanding early planetary evolution and the necessary conditions that might foster the emergence of life [3].",
        "Observations from decades of orbital and landed missions have fundamentally shifted the understanding of Mars from a static, geologically dead world to a dynamic one with a complex and evolving history. Data from the MAVEN mission conclusively revealed that the loss of the planet's global magnetic field early in its history allowed the solar wind to strip away much of its previously thick atmosphere, driving the drastic climate transition to its current cold, arid state [4]. Furthermore, the InSight lander overturned assumptions of an inactive interior by detecting hundreds of marsquakes, indicating that the planet remains seismically active, particularly in the Cerberus Fossae region where faulting suggests ongoing tectonic processes [2]."
