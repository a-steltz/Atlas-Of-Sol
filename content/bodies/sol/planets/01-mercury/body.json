        "Mercury possesses an unexpectedly large iron core, comprising about 85% of its planetary radius and leaving only a thin outer shell of silicate mantle and crust [4].",
        "Despite its extreme proximity to the Sun, permanently shadowed craters at Mercury's poles act as cold traps containing significant deposits of water ice [2].",
        "The planet exhibits a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, rotating precisely three times on its axis for every two orbits around the Sun [1].",
        "Mercury generates a weak but globally measurable dipole magnetic field, approximately 1% the strength of Earth's, indicating a partially liquid outer core [2].",

        "Mercury stands as an extraordinary laboratory for understanding the extremes of planetary formation in the inner solar system. As the smallest and innermost terrestrial planet, its bulk composition is characterized by a massive metallic core that comprises approximately 85% of its planetary radius, dominating its interior volume and challenging traditional accretion models [4]. Prior to the MESSENGER mission, it was widely hypothesized that Mercury's proximity to the Sun and potential massive impacts would have depleted its volatile elements; however, orbital spectrometry revealed significant concentrations of potassium, sulfur, and other volatiles, contradicting the giant impact hypothesis as the sole explanation for its high density [2].",
        "The planet's modern scientific narrative is defined by surprising complexities, including the confirmation of a weak, intrinsic global magnetic field offset to the north, which suggests ongoing dynamo action within a partially fluid outer core [2]. Another highly counterintuitive discovery was the definitive identification of water ice in permanently shadowed polar craters, surviving just a short distance from the Sun's intense radiation due to Mercury's minimal axial tilt [2]. Furthermore, the detection of small, crisp thrust fault scarps indicates that Mercury may still be tectonically active today as the planetary body continues to cool and contract [3]. These findings have fundamentally reshaped our understanding of how terrestrial planets form, evolve, and retain materials in close proximity to their host stars."
