        "Saturn stands out as the solar system's second-largest gas giant and the only planet with a bulk density lower than that of liquid water [1]. Its most visually defining and scientifically extraordinary feature is an expansive, highly structured ring system composed almost entirely of water ice particles ranging in size from micrometers to meters [2]. The planet's atmosphere is a deep envelope dominated by hydrogen and helium, characterized by fierce equatorial winds and a unique, persistent hexagonal jet stream dominating its north pole  [2].",
        "The 13-year Cassini-Huygens mission fundamentally transformed our understanding of the Saturnian system. During its final, close-in orbits, the spacecraft mapped the planet's gravity and magnetic fields with unprecedented precision. A major surprise was the revelation that Saturn's magnetic axis is aligned almost perfectly with its rotation axis—a highly unusual configuration that challenges prevailing theories of planetary dynamos [3]. Additionally, Cassini's measurements of the rings' mass provided strong evidence that they are surprisingly young, likely forming only 10 to 100 million years ago from the destruction of an icy moon [2].",
        "Studying Saturn provides critical insights into the formation and evolution of gas giants across the cosmos. Its complex interior, which likely features a diffuse or 'fuzzy' boundary between a heavy-element core and a deep metallic hydrogen envelope, serves as a natural laboratory for probing extreme high-pressure physics [3]. Understanding the mechanisms driving Saturn's internal heat generation, atmospheric dynamics, and anomalous magnetic field remains central to broader models of planetary system architecture."
