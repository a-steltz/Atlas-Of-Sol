        "Europa represents one of the most compelling targets in the search for extraterrestrial life due to its vast, global subsurface ocean of liquid water [2]. Beneath an outer ice shell estimated to be 10 to 25 kilometers thick, this ocean may contain more than twice the liquid water found in all of Earth's oceans combined, maintained in a liquid state by tidal heating driven by Jupiter's massive gravity [1, 2].",
        "The confirmation of Europa's subsurface ocean emerged primarily from the Galileo mission, which detected an induced magnetic field responding dynamically to Jupiter's rotating magnetosphere [2]. This signature strongly indicated the presence of a global, electrically conductive fluid layer beneath the surface, widely accepted to be a salty water ocean [2]. Additionally, transient water vapor plumes observed by the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that this ocean or shallower lakes may occasionally vent directly into space [3].",
        "Europa's geology is highly active, featuring a young surface lacking large impact craters and covered in complex networks of ridges, bands, and chaotic terrain [4]. Evidence of ice plate tectonics, including subduction-like processes, suggests a dynamic recycling of the ice shell that could transport surface oxidants down to the ocean [5]. This potential chemical cycling makes Europa a prime laboratory for studying the conditions necessary for habitability in the outer solar system [4, 5]."
